## What We're Creating
We are creating a set of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) using the proper ERC Standards. Our NFT Collection will be based on smart contracts that we will code ourselves using the Remix IDE and Solidity programming language. The NFTs will contain a set of 3 randomized NBA player names and each one will of course be unique. We chose this as our project to showcase our understanding of Solidity, Smart Contracts and working with the blockchain in general. 

## What Is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT)?
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. This differs from fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies, which are identical to each other and, therefore, can serve as a medium for commercial transactions.

## Usage & Installation
As mentioned previously we are coding our smart contracts using the Remix IDE, we are using Solidity version 0.8.0 and importing the OpenZeppelin contracts.

## Creating the SVG
When the NFT is minted it will be an svg image consisting of 3 NBA player names, no minted NFT will be exactly identical to another, we can accomplish this by using following code in our smart contract



## Minting the NFT
What is minting you ask? When you mint an NFT you are basically recording its data onto the blockchain. This way everyone can see that this NFT belongs to you and you only. Since it is now on the blockchain no one can steal or edit your NFT, it will always be yours until you sell or transfer it to another party. We can mint our NFT by using the following code in our smart contract



## Deploying the Contract
Now we must deploy our contract to make sure it does what we told it to, which is mint our NFT. Using the Remix IDE we can deploy our smart contract to the testnet and begin minting NFTs as we please! You can see here that the contract has been succesfully deployed


## The Final Product
After successfully coding and deploying our contract to the testnet we can mint our first NFT, and *drumroll*...here it is! Our first minted NFT
